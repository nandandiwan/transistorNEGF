# Silicon Nano-Transistor NEGF Simulation

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation for modeling silicon nano-transistors using the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism. The simulation aims to understand and predict the behavior of ultra-thin MOSFET devices (3-10 nm channel heights) where quantum effects become dominant. In particular the sim hopes to explain why 3 nm thickness tranistor has a steeper ID-VG curve than 6 nm thickness transistor. 

## Overview

The simulation consists of two main components:
1. **Tight-Binding Model with Finite Z-Direction**: Provides the fundamental electronic structure and effective mass parameters
2. **NEGF Quantum Transport Simulation**: Implements self-consistent Poisson-NEGF solver for 2D (periodic in y) silicon nano-transistors

The ultimate goal is to extend the proven 1D multi-orbital NEGF implementation (see `test_device_multiple_orbitals.ipynb`) to a full 2D periodic silicon nano-transistor simulation.
